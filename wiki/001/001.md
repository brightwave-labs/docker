# HOW-TO

## Dockerize your helloworld application

This is a how-to guide, and if the steps are followed then the reader will be
able to run the hello world application inside the container.

## Approach

1. Writing `Go` code to print `Hello World` on console.
2. Setting up the `Dockerfile` and compile the binary inside the container.
3. Set the binary as an entrypoint for the docker.

## Prerequistie

1. Knowledge of docker.

## Step 1: Installation of `Docker Engine` on `Ubuntu`

- We have to setup the `Docker` repository to install and update.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
```

The above commands will update the `apt` package index and install the required
tools to setup the keys.

- Add Dockerâ€™s official GPG key.

```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```

- Use the following command to set up the repository.

```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

- Need to update the `apt` package index after setting up repository.

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

- Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose.

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

- Verify that the `docker` has been installed successfully by running below
command.

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

## Step 2: Installation of `golang` on `Ubuntu`

- Download the go from this [link](https://go.dev/dl/) or [direct downnload](https://go.dev/dl/go1.20.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz).

- Once downloaded, remove the existing version if any and install the new one by
running below command.

```bash
rm -rf /usr/local/go && tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.20.4.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

- Add the `go` to your PATH variable by updating `$HOME/.bashrc` file with below
line.

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

- Restart the shell and verify your `go` installation by running below command.

```bash
go version
```

## Step 3: Start by creating a `main.go` file

You will find the complete code for the file [HERE](../../examples/001/main.go).

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello World")
}
```

## Step 4: Compile and run the application

- Open your terminal to compile and run the application.

- Change to the directory, where the file is created.
 
```bash
go run main.go 
```

The expected output by running the above command is `Hello World`.

```bash
brightwave@brightwavebot:~/docker/examples/001$ go run main.go 
Hello World
```

## Step 4: Adding `Dockerfile`

- Add a `Dockerfile` in the same directory and can be found [here](../../examples/001/Dockerfile).

```Dockerfile
FROM golang:1.20

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .
RUN go build -v -o /usr/local/bin/app ./...

CMD ["app"]
```

## Step 5: Building the `docker image`

- The image can be build by using below command.

```bash
docker build -t helloworld-app:1.0.0 .
```

- And, can be run in container like below.

```bash
docker run -it --rm --name helloworld-running-app helloworld-app:1.0.0
```

And, you will see the `Hello World` printed on the console.
